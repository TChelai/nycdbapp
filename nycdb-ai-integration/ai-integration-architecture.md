# Generative AI Integration Architecture for NYCDB Web Application

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for integrating generative AI capabilities into the existing NYCDB web application. The integration will allow users to interact with complex NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) datasets using natural language queries, receive tailored insights, and explore data through an intuitive conversational interface.

## System Components

The generative AI integration will consist of the following components:

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module

- **Purpose**: Interpret user queries in plain language and convert them into structured database queries
- **Key Features**:
  - Query intent classification (e.g., risk assessment, trend analysis, specific building lookup)
  - Entity extraction (locations, building types, time periods, violation types)
  - Query parameter identification (filters, aggregations, sorting criteria)
  - Context management for follow-up questions
- **Implementation**:
  - Backend service using a modern NLP library/framework
  - Pre-trained language model fine-tuned for NYC DOB domain terminology
  - Query template system for common question patterns

### 2. Data Retrieval and Query System

- **Purpose**: Transform NLP-interpreted queries into database operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic SQL query generation based on NLP output
  - Multi-dataset join operations for complex queries
  - Query optimization for performance
  - Pagination and result limiting for large datasets
- **Implementation**:
  - Extension of existing dataset controller functionality
  - Integration with PostgREST for efficient data access
  - Caching layer for frequently requested data

### 3. AI Analysis Engine

- **Purpose**: Process retrieved data to generate insights and perform advanced analysis
- **Key Features**:
  - Risk assessment algorithms for building safety analysis
  - Time-series analysis for trend detection
  - Pattern recognition for violation clustering
  - Comparative analysis across neighborhoods or building types
  - Statistical analysis for outlier detection
- **Implementation**:
  - Backend service with specialized analysis modules
  - Integration with data science libraries
  - Configurable analysis parameters based on query context

### 4. Results Generation Module

- **Purpose**: Transform analysis results into human-readable insights and visualizations
- **Key Features**:
  - Natural language explanation generation
  - Key findings summarization
  - Dynamic visualization creation (charts, maps, etc.)
  - Confidence scoring for insights
- **Implementation**:
  - Template-based text generation system
  - Integration with existing visualization components
  - Markdown/HTML formatting for structured responses

### 5. Interactive Refinement Interface

- **Purpose**: Allow users to refine and explore their queries conversationally
- **Key Features**:
  - Follow-up question handling
  - Query suggestion generation
  - Result filtering and focusing
  - Conversation history management
- **Implementation**:
  - Frontend chat-like interface
  - State management for conversation context
  - Suggestion chips for common refinements

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User enters a natural language query in the AI interface
2. **Query Processing**:
   - NLP module interprets the query intent and extracts entities
   - System identifies relevant datasets and query parameters
3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Query system constructs and executes database queries
   - Results are retrieved from the PostgreSQL database via PostgREST
4. **Analysis**:
   - AI analysis engine processes the retrieved data
   - System applies appropriate analytical methods based on query intent
5. **Response Generation**:
   - Results generation module creates natural language explanations
   - System generates appropriate visualizations
6. **User Interaction**:
   - Response is presented to the user
   - User can ask follow-up questions or refine the query
   - System maintains context for conversation continuity

## Integration Points with Existing Application

### Backend Integration

1. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/ai/query` - Process natural language queries
   - `/api/ai/analyze` - Run analysis on specified datasets
   - `/api/ai/conversation` - Manage conversation context and history

2. **Extensions to Existing Controllers**:
   - Enhance `datasets.ts` controller with AI query capabilities
   - Add AI analysis functions to data processing pipeline

3. **Database Additions**:
   - New table for storing conversation history
   - New table for caching common query results
   - New table for saving user-specific AI preferences

### Frontend Integration

1. **New Components**:
   - AI Query Interface component
   - Conversation History component
   - AI-Generated Visualization component
   - Query Refinement component

2. **UI Integration Points**:
   - New "AI Assistant" tab in main navigation
   - AI query option in Dataset Explorer
   - Integration with existing visualization components
   - AI insights panel in Dataset Detail view

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Requirements

- Node.js environment (existing)
- NLP library (new dependency)
- Data analysis libraries (new dependencies)
- Vector database for semantic search (optional new component)
- Enhanced caching system for AI responses

### Frontend Requirements

- Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse
- AI-generated insights will be clearly labeled as such
- Confidence scores will be provided for uncertain analyses

## Performance Considerations

- Caching of common queries and their results
- Asynchronous processing for complex analyses
- Progressive loading of large result sets
- Background processing for time-intensive operations
- Optimized database queries for frequently accessed data

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core NLP and Basic Query Handling
